Rules:
hit = get 1 more card
stand = do not get more cards
your score is the sum of your cards
cards that are 10 or higher all count as 10s, that's why 12,13,14 missing
ace is 11 if your hand is under 21, but it transforms into 1 if 11 would bust the hand
the one closer to 21 (but not higher) wins
21 is blackjack (best hand)
dealer(computer) draws untill their hand is atleast 17
